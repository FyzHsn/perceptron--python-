perceptron-python
=================

This repository contains notes on the perceptron machine learning algorithm. The python scripts are from the book Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. Meanwhile, the R script is my implementation in the program R.

Furthermore, the algorithm is then applied to the iris data set of flower species and their dependence on petal and sepal dimensions.

I have played around with the data some more in the Rmd file beyond the python scripts.

However, Raschka outlines a plotting code to visualize the descision boundary for the 2D data set. This is very useful and would be nice to implement in R.

Lastly, html file of the Rmd file published on my rpubs account is [here](https://rpubs.com/FaiHas/197581).
